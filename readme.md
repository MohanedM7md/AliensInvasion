<div class="Project Intro">
    <h2 align="center" id="Intro">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
    This C++ project program that <u>simulates</u> the battle against alien armies and <u>calculates</u> some related <b>statistics</b> in order to help decision makers around the world. It uses different ways to keep track of soldiers and stuff for both sides. The game looks simple but it's really smart under the hood. with a GUI that is simple and It shows everything happening in the game on the screen using the interactive mode, and you can choose to watch it step by step or just let it run quietly in the background and check out what happened later using silent mode.
    </p>

<div class="Features">

<h2 align="center" id="fea">Features</h2>

- Simulates a war between Earth and Aliens.
- Utilizes the following data structures:
    - Earth: FIFO soldier, LIFO tank, FIFO healer, priorityQueue gunnery.
    - Aliens: FIFO soldiers, random array picker monsters, doublelinkedQueue Drones.
- Custom console GUI featuring:
    - Loading screen.
    - Menu items.
    - Printing screen.
- Game Manager featuring:
    - Handles input files perfectly and generates output files showing battle results and statistics.
    - Interactive mode enables users to watch each simulation step by clicking any key.
    - Silent mode generates output files without displaying simulation steps.

<div class="How Works">
<h2 align="center" id="Work">How The Game Works üé≤</h2>

The Game is all about probablity it takes the input ranges of both armies from a text file
(for more info about 
<a href="#input"> Input File </a> see below
) a random genrator uses the ranges from the input files to generates units of both armies the game runs for 500 time step where each time step the two armies attacks each other after the 500 time step one of the arimes win or the battle ends with draw


</div>

<div class="Input-Txt">

<h2 align="center" id="input">Input File Format üìÉ</h2>

The input file should adhere to the specified format, providing details about Earth and Alien forces, their formations, and strategies.



```YML
    #probablity of Genration in percentage
    Probablity: 100
    #number of Genrated Unit per Genrations
    N: 7
    #Units probablities in percentage
    ES%,ET%,EG%,%HU: 40 50 5 5
    AS%,AM%,AD%: 30 25 45
    #      Ranges of Armies     # 
    #! Warning! don't change in the order of the paramters[Power health AttackCapacity] or in thier fomrat.[min-max] !#
    #?instead you can change the numbers values

    #Eearth Ranges
    power,health,attack_capacity: 3-50 30-90 2-5
    #Alien Ranges
    power,health,attack_capacity: 1-20 40-80 1-4
    #Allied Range
    power,health,attack_capacity: 1-20 40-80 1-4
    #Extra inputs
    #Treshold percentage for calling the ally , The percentag of creating this army
